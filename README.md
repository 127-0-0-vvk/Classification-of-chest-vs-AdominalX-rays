Intro to deep learning for medical imaging by MD.ai
Lesson 1. Classification of chest vs. adominal X-rays
This is a high-level introduction into practical machine learning for medical image classification. The goal of this tutorial is to build a deep learning classifier to accurately differentiate between chest and abdominal X-rays. The model is trained using 75 images de-identified images obtained from Open-i.

MD.ai is used to dispaly the DICOM images, and to create the image-level annotations. We then use the MD.ai python client library to download the images+annotations and prepare the datasets, which are then used to train the classification model.
